Process Scheduling Simulator

ðŸ“Œ Project Abstract

The Process Scheduling Simulator is an educational software tool designed to demonstrate and analyze various CPU scheduling algorithms used in operating systems. Its primary goal is to provide an interactive platform for visualizing how different scheduling strategies manage multiple processes based on arrival time, burst time, and priority.

Developed using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface, the simulator supports major scheduling algorithms, including:
	â€¢	First-Come First-Serve (FCFS)
	â€¢	Shortest Job First (SJF)
	â€¢	Round Robin (RR)
	â€¢	Priority Scheduling

Users can input custom process data and select an algorithm to simulate. The simulator then computes and displays key performance metrics such as:
	â€¢	Waiting Time
	â€¢	Turnaround Time
	â€¢	Completion Time
	â€¢	Average values of these metrics

This tool serves as a learning aid for computer science students by bridging the gap between theoretical concepts and practical application. It allows users to experiment with different process scenarios and immediately observe how scheduling decisions impact system performance.

By focusing on clarity, simplicity, and flexibility, the simulator becomes a valuable resource for both teaching and self-learning purposes. Through visualizing the inner workings of CPU scheduling, it enhances comprehension and provides deeper insights into process management and system-level decision-making.
